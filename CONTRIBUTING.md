# How to Edit FMHY

There are two ways you can contribe to this repository:
- [Link submissions](#submitting-a-link)
- [Reporting a site](#reporting-a-site)
- Changes to the website itself

### Submitting a Link

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you haven't tested the link you'd like to submit, especially if it's a DDL site, please open an **[Issue](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/issues)** or reach out to us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/5W9QJKuPkD)** rather than making a Pull Request.

**1.** Before submitting a link, please **[search](https://redd.it/105xraz)** to make sure it's not already in the wiki.

**2.** The order of priority is: **Site > Git Repository > Store Link**
Please only use the store link if there's neither a site nor a Git repository available for the app/extension you'd like to submit.

**3.** Always check to see if the site you'd like to submit has a Discord / Telegram server you can link with it.

**4.** Never edit the single-page, it contains all the pages of the wiki and gets updated automatically.

**5.** Find a suitable category for the link and then submit it by making a **[Pull Request](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pulls)**. 

#### Don't Submit:

**🕹️ Emulators**
They're already on the **[Game Tech Wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Main_Page)**.

**🔻 Leeches**
They're already on the **[File Hosting Wiki](https://filehostlist.miraheze.org/wiki/Free_Premium_Leeches)**.

**🐧 Distros**
They're already on **[DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com/)**.

**🎲 Mining / Betting Sites**
Don't post anything related to betting, mining, BINs, CCs, etc.

**🎮 Multiplayer Game Hacks**
Don't post any hacks/exploits that give unfair advantages in multiplayer games.

### Reporting a Site

> [!TIP]
> If you want to make bigger changes to the wiki, such as debloating or restructuring a page/section, please discuss those changes with us via **[Discord](https://discord.gg/5W9QJKuPkD)** before making a **[Pull Request](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pulls)**.

You can do one of the following:

- Open an **[Issue](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/issues)** or a **[Pull Request](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pulls)** and don't forget to explain why you think the site(s) in question should be removed, unstarred, and/or changed.

- Alternatively, you can reach out to us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/5W9QJKuPkD)** if you're unsure whether the site should be reported or if you'd like to discuss your report with more people.
